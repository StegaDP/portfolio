## Myself, My Skills, and My Projects

### My name is **Dmitry Stegailo**, and I specialize in software development using Python.

## **Examples:**

- [AnimeBot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102144407/213987069-b817265a-9e56-4859-bdf7-131c44948ecc.png)
  - A fully asynchronous Telegram Bot working with the DDM neural network.
- [Asynchronous QQDDM Parser](https://github.com/StegaDP/python-qqddm-async)
  - Forked from the main repository to optimize and speed up requests (average time per request reduced from 20 to 12 seconds).
- [Simple Telegram Bot for OGE Math Preparation](https://t.me/project_OGEmath_bot)
  - Developed using [sdamgia-api](https://github.com/StegaDP/sdamgia-api), which I modified from the original repository.
- [Telegram Bot for Investments](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102144407/214104150-18071bd6-2d34-4bc4-a46b-095c6f7e87fc.jpg)
  - Developed based on my experience in creating similar content-filled Telegram bots.

  - Used an API to get a list of transactions for a specific wallet.
- Implemented a bot for ruble payments in Turkey through the Fast Payment System (under NDA).
- Created a multiplayer game based on a Telegram bot related to investments.
- Contributed to a project for creating a bot related to DeepFake: developed a microservice responsible for processing videos and photos based on a pre-trained neural network.
- Implemented a payment module for AlfaBank payments using the Fast Payment System, and a module for one-stage payments with Tinkoff.

*These are just the projects I personally like the most, in reality, my portfolio is three times more extensive.
